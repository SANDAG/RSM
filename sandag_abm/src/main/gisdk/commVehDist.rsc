   CommVehTOD.rsc

  TransCAD Macro used to run truck commercial vehicle distribution model.  The very small truck generation model is based on the Phoenix
  four-tire truck model documented in the TMIP Quick Response Freight Manual.

  A simple gravity model is used to distribute the truck trips.  A blended travel time is used as the impedance measure,
  specifically the weighted average of the AM travel time (one-third weight) and the midday travel time (two-thirds weight).

 Input:  (1) Level-of-service matrices for the AM peak period (6 am to 10 am) and midday period (10 am to 3 pm)
             which contain truck-class specific estimates of congested travel time (in minutes)
         (2) Trip generation results in ASCII format with the following fields
               (a) TAZ:  zone number;
               (b) PROD:  very small truck trip productions;
               (c) ATTR:  very small truck trip attractions;
         (4) A table of friction factors in ASCII format with the following fields (each 12 columns wide): (a)
             impedance measure (blended travel time); (b) friction factors for very small trucks;

 Output: (1) A production/attraction trip table matrix of daily class-specific truck trips for very small trucks.
         (2) A blended travel time matrix

 See also: (1) CommVehGen.rsc, which applies the generation model.
           (2) CommVehTOD.rsc, which applies diurnal factors to the daily trips generated here.
